## Recursion

recursion is when an action repeats itself infinitely. This is caused by some loop that calls itself, and never ends. The important distinction of recursion is that the concept contains itself. [^WikiRecursion] [^Recursion1] [^Recursion2]

Some examples of recursion can be:

- A sourdough starter, which requires some sourdough starter from before, thus requiring itself to exist. 
- A recursive loop in programming, which will call itself, and never ends
