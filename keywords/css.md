### Definition
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet, is a language used to style HTML or XML documents. CSS gives developpers and designers the power to change the presentation of a webpage/website [^meyer01css]. They can personnalize everything from fonts, to colors, to the layout [^robbins02css]. More experienced developpers can even play around with the behavior of a page.
