##Lossless
Lossless is when there is no loss in data. When compressing a file, we want to store fewer bits all while preserving the original content [^crashcourse2017lossless], this is so that data is easier to store or transmit more efficiently[^lu2016lossless]. Lossless compression occurs when the decompressed data is the same as before the compression occurred[^crashcourse2017lossless]. For example, PNG is a lossless compression [^brian2022lossless], the compression does not affect the quality of the image.
