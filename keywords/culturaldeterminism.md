## Cultural Determinism

Culture is the sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another. Determinism is a philosophical position whereby every event has conditions that could not be caused by any other means. Collectively then, cultural determinism is a theory which bases our emotional and behavioral levels upon the culture in which we are raised, meaning that our culture and social influences dominate biological influences.[^feenberg23CD]
