# Glossary of keywords related to new media.

The following list is constantly updated by the CART210 community throughout the term.

Each student must:

- add the three terms chosen as individual files inside the `keywords` folder of the repository
- name each individual keyword file in lowercase and use the file extension `.md` (Markdown)
- define the concept in their own words, with precision and conciseness
- cite their sources of information in strict Chicago author-year format. Three references minimum per entry, and two of them must be from academic sources (i.e., book, article, or conference paper). Add your bibliographic entry at the end of the list, in the right alphabetic order.
- provide links in the form of internal references to other terms in the glossary
- provide links to external references in the form of HTTP links

To commit changes, each contributor will create a pull request using the [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub) web based interface. Contributors who know how to interact with [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub) using other environment (e.g., CLI or IDE), can also use those.

The glossary will be improved throughout the term, with three sprint deadlines.
