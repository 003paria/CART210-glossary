# List of keywords related to new media.

The following list is constantly updated by the students throughout the term.

Each student must:

- add the three terms chosen to the list in a strict alphabetic order
- define the concept in their own words, with precision and conciseness
- cite their sources of information in strict Chicago author-year format. Three references minimum per entry, and two of them must be from academic sources (i.e., book, article, or conference paper). Add your bibliographic entry at the end of the list, in the right alphabetic order.
- provide links in the form of internal references to other terms in the glossary
- provide links to external references in the form of HTTP links

The glossary will be improved throughout the term, with three sprint deadlines.
