##Hypertext

Ted Nelson first introduces the term in his 1965 paper “A File Structure for the Complex, the changing and the indeterminate”, describing it as “a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper”.[^TedNelson1965]

Hypertext is a digital form of writing text, exploiting the use of hyperlinks. Commonly found in webpages, documents or files, hyperlinks are clickable & link to other webpages/texts/media on the internet (commonly known as “links”). [The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/) defines hypertext as “text stored in a computer system that contains links that allow the user to move from one piece of text or document to another”.[^OxfordHypertext]

Hypertext allows people to easily access information from multiple sources and navigate through and between multiple documents from different sources on the web. As a form of information management, hypertext allows for a non-linear, and less restrictive exploration of digital content & information.[^JSMERP16]
